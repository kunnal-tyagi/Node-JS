Transactions in SQL are a way to group multiple queries so they behave as one atomic unit — meaning either all of them succeed or none of them do.
They're essential for maintaining data integrity.

A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations executed as a single unit of work.

A transaction must follow ACID:

->Atomicity – all or nothing
->Consistency – database remains valid
->Isolation – transactions don’t interfere
->Durability – once committed, changes persist
